# Using Perforce depots with Sourcegraph

> NOTE: <span class="badge badge-experimental">Experimental</span> Perforce support is a work in progressâ€”see [known issues and limitations](#known-issues-and-limitations).

Sourcegraph supports [Perforce Helix](https://www.perforce.com/solutions/version-control) depots using [p4-fusion](https://github.com/salesforce/p4-fusion). This creates an equivalent Git repository from a Perforce depot, which can then be indexed by Sourcegraph.

## Add a Perforce code host connection

Perforce depots can be added to a Sourcegraph instance by adding the appropriate [code host connection](../external_service/index.md).

1. Perforce code host connections are still an experimental feature. To access this functionality, a site admin must enable the experimental feature in the [site configuration](../config/site_config.md):

    ```json
    {
      "experimentalFeatures": {
        "perforce": "enabled"
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```
1. Go to **Site admin > Manage code hosts > Add code host**
1. Select **Perforce**.
1. Configure which depots are mirrored/synchronized as Git repositories to Sourcegraph:

    - [`depots`](perforce.md#depots)<br>A list of depot paths that can be either a depot root or an arbitrary subdirectory. **Note**: Only `"local"` type depots are supported.
    - [`p4.user`](perforce.md#p4-user)<br>The user to be authenticated for p4 CLI, and should be capable of performing `p4 ping`, `p4 login`, `p4 trust` and any p4 commands involved with `git p4 clone` and `git p4 sync` for listed `depots`. If repository permissions are mirrored, the user needs additional ability to perform the `p4 protects`, `p4 groups`, `p4 group`, `p4 users` commands (aka. "super" access level).
    - [`p4.passwd`](perforce.md#p4-passwd)<br>The ticket value to be used for authenticating the `p4.user`. It is recommended to create tickets of users in a group that never expire. Use the command `p4 -u <p4.user> login -p -a` to obtain a ticket value.

    See the [configuration documentation below](#configuration) for other fields you can configure.

1. **Optional, but recommended**: use the [`p4-fusion`](https://github.com/salesforce/p4-fusion) client by configuring `fusionClient` for better performance:

    ```json
    {
        // ...
        "fusionClient": {
          "enabled": true,
          "lookAhead": 2000
        }
    }
    ```

    Details of all `p4-fusion` configuration fields can be seen [here](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@2a716bd70c294acf1b3679b790834c4dea9ea956/-/blob/schema/perforce.schema.json?L84).

    Without the `fusionClient` configuration, the code host connection uses `git p4`, but we recommend `p4-fusion` for better performance.

1. Click **Add repositories**.

Sourcegraph will now talk to the Perforce host and sync the configured `depots` to the Sourcegraph instance.

It's worthwhile to note some limitations of this process:

- When syncing depots either [git p4](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-p4) or [p4-fusion](https://github.com/salesforce/p4-fusion) (recommended) are used to convert Perforce depots into git repositories so that Sourcegraph can index them.
- Rename of a Perforce depot, including changing the depot on the Perforce server or the `repositoryPathPattern` config option, will cause a re-import of the depot.
- Unless [permissions syncing](#repository-permissions) is enabled, Sourcegraph knows nothing of the permissions on the depots, so it can't enforce access restrictions.

## Repository permissions

To enable permissions syncing for Perforce depots using [Perforce permissions tables](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html), include [the `authorization` field](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@2a716bd70c294acf1b3679b790834c4dea9ea956/-/blob/schema/perforce.schema.json?L67) to the configuration of the Perforce code host connection you created [above](#add-a-perforce-code-host):

```json
{
  // ...
  "authorization": {}
}
```

Adding the `authorization` field to the code host connection configugation will enable partial parsing of the permissions tables. If this is the extent of your configuring, then you should sync subdirectories of a depot using the `depots` configuration that best describes the most concrete path of your permissions boundary.

For example, if your Perforce depot `//depot/Talkhouse` has different permissions for `//depot/Talkhouse/main-dev` and some subdirectories of `//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0`, we recommend setting the following `depots`:

```json
{
  // ...
  "depots": [
    "//depot/Talkhouse/main-dev",
    "//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/front",
    "//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/back"
  ]
}
```

By configuring each subdirectory that has unique permissions, Sourcegraph is able to recognize and enforce permissions for the sub-directories. You can **NOT** define these permissions as:

```json
{
  // ...
  "depots": [
    "//depot/Talkhouse/main-dev",
    "//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0",
    "//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/back"
  ]
}
```

Since that would override the permissions for the `//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/back` depot.

### File-level permissions

File-level permissions make the splitting of depots by sub-directory unnecessary.

To enable file-level permissions:

1. Enable [the feature in the site config](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@2a716bd/-/blob/schema/site.schema.json?L227&subtree=true?L227):

    ```json
    {
      // ...
      "experimentalFeatures": {
        "perforce": "enabled",
        "subRepoPermissions": { "enabled": true }
      }
    }
    ```
1. Enable the feature in the code host configuration by adding `subRepoPermissions` to the `authorization` object:

    ```json
    {
      // ...
      "authorization": {
        "subRepoPermissions": true
      }
    }
    ```

2. Save the configuration. Permissions will be synced in the background based on your [Perforce permissions tables](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html).

Sourcegraph users are mapped to Perforce users based on their verified e-mail addresses.

As long as a user has been granted at least `Read` permissions in Perforce they will be able to view content in Sourcegraph.

As a special case, commits in which a user does not have permissions to read any files are hidden. If a user can read a subset of files in a commit, only those files are shown.

## Known issues and limitations

We are actively working to significantly improve Sourcegraph's Perforce support. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues) to help us prioritize any specific improvements you'd like to see.

- Sourcegraph was initially built for Git repositories only, so it exposes Git concepts that are meaningless for converted Perforce depots, such as the commit SHA, branches, and tags.
- The commit messages for a Perforce depot converted to a Git repository have an extra line at the end with Perforce information, such as `[git-p4: depot-paths = "//guest/example_org/myproject/": change = 12345]`.
- [Permissions](#repository-permissions)
  - [File-level permissions](#file-level-permissions) are not supported when syncing permissions via the [code host integration](#add-a-perforce-code-host).
  - The [host field](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html#Form_Fields_..361) in protections are not supported.
